# CHARACTER COMPONENTS FOR UNREAL ENGINE 5
A modular approach on different types of pawns, simple and easy to use to quickly setup a new scene.

## RTS PAWN
Currently includes an component for an RTS Pawn, complete with a preset actor with the components applied.
For RTS the following logic components are avalaible besides the base movement component:
```
Edge Scrolling: Adds edge scrolling to the pawn.
Marquee Selector: Adds the possibility to create a selection box during runtime using mouse-clicks.
Selection System: Adds functionality to select and interact with specific objects during runtime. 
```
## FPS PAWN
Also includes an component for a simple FPS Pawn, complete with a preset actor with the components applied:
For the FPS the following logic components are available besides the base movement component:
```
Interactable: Allows for interaction with objects while using the FPS pawn with objects using the BPI_Interactable Interface. 
```

Also includes a component for switching between different pawns efficiently. 

This version of the project is not stable and should not be used in production. Later releases hope to fix this.
